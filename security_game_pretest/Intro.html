    Imagine that you and another study participant each received ${{ Constants.endowment }}. In this scenario:

    One of you will have the choice to try and steal ############ from the other, with a ########## % chance of success.
    If one's attempted theft fails, they will instead lose ${{ Constants.endowment }}, with the target losing nothing.

One participant from this study will be randomly selected to receive a bonus payment based on their decision in the second scenario,
where you received $300.
<br>
<br>


<b>For your potential payoff:</b>
<br><br>
You consumed <span id="consumed"> </span> units of the security product, spending $<span id="spent"> </span>.
After your purchasing decision, the new probability of a theft being successful was <span id="new_prob"></span>%. <br><br>


<span id="success_theft"></span> <br><br>

If selected for the bonus payment, your final payoff will be $<span id="final_payoff"></span>.
The bonus will be added to the selected participantâ€™s Prolific account within 72 hours of the study completion time. <br><br>

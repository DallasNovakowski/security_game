<p>
<div><span>The study you just participated in was designed to understand whether
    inequality increases consumers’ willingness to consume security products.</span></div>
</p>

<p>
<div><span> You were told that you would be completing this study with a partner, but the information on this partner was not true: <u>there was no partner</u>.
    This deception was necessary for controlling the costs of this project – data on the actions of your partner were not important for the research questions at hand.
    Likewise, all participants in this study were paid the same amount, so if you decided to consume security products, it did not affect your final payoff. </span></div>
</p>

<p>
<div><span>The consumption of security goods seems to indicate one’s mistrust and fear of other people.
    Every dollar spent on a heavy-duty deadbolt cannot be spent on other goods such as savings or healthcare.
    As such, some security goods are only worthwhile when assuming that others are malicious. </span></div>
</p>

<p>
<div><span>Currently, other humans (via murder) are only outranked by mosquitoes as the deadliest animal to modern Homo sapiens.
    At the same time, our species’ success has been completely dependent on living and working closely together.
    Understanding how and when people pay the costs of security may be instrumental in understanding how people navigate the dilemmas of competition and cooperation. </span></div>
</p>

<p>
<div><span>Studies suggests that inequality leads to risk-taking and conflict.
    In a “winner-takes-all” environment, individuals are more likely to resort to risky and criminal activities
    to effectively compete for desired goals (especially when they are relatively worse off).
    In a word, inequality breeds desperation. Given that inequality exists to some degree all modern societies,
    it is important to understand whether inequality causes people to expect desperation and risk-taking from others.
    This expectation of desperation may be critical in driving people’s willingness to consume products that protect them from malicious competitive behaviours. </span></div>
</p>

<p>
<div><span>
If our results show that inequality indeed leads to security consumption, it will highlight economic disparities as an important consideration for managers and policy makers when attempting to understand, predict, and satisfy people’s need for security.

Thank you for participating in this study! Your time and effort are very appreciated.

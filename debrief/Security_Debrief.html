<div><span>The study you just participated in was designed to test the effect of income inequality on security consumption.
    Previous research suggests that inequality causes people to expect desperation and risk-taking from others.
    This expectation of desperation may be critical in driving people’s willingness to consume products that protect them
    from harmful competitive behaviors. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions:
    “equal” initial endowment vs. “unequal” initial endowment. We expect that people in the “unequal” condition would
    spend more on security products than those in the “equal” condition.   </span></div>
</p>

<p>
<div><span> You were told that you would be completing the study with a partner.
    In reality, the partner is a computer program designed to attempt theft 50% of the time.
    Controlling the partner’s behavior was necessary for a clean test of our hypothesis.

    <u>Explanation of the bonus payment:</u>
        <br>

One participant from this study will be randomly selected to receive a bonus payment based on their decision in the second scenario,
where you received $300. The bonus payment is determined based on:
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li> The initial endowment of the randomly selected participant = $300.</li>
    <li> A theft attempt will always be made, the probability that it will succeed is 50%.</li>
    <li> If an attempted theft is successful, the stolen amount is $100.</li>
    <li> The selected participant’s decision to purchase security products.</li>
    <li> Each unit of the security product costs $2 and reduces the probability of a successful theft by 0.5%.</li>
</ul>

 </span></div>

<!--<p>-->
<!--<div><span>The consumption of security goods seems to indicate one’s mistrust and fear of other people.-->
<!--    Every dollar spent on a heavy-duty deadbolt cannot be spent on other goods such as savings or healthcare.-->
<!--    As such, some security goods are only worthwhile when assuming that others are malicious. </span></div>-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--<div><span>Currently, other humans (via murder) are only outranked by mosquitoes as the deadliest animal to modern Homo sapiens.-->
<!--    At the same time, our species’ success has been completely dependent on living and working closely together.-->
<!--    Understanding how and when people pay the costs of security may be instrumental in understanding how people navigate the dilemmas of competition and cooperation. </span></div>-->

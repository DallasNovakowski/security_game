<p>
<div><span>The study you just participated in was designed to understand whether
    inequality increases consumers’ willingness to consume security products.</span></div>
</p>

<p>
<div><span> You were told that you would be completing this study with a partner, but the information on this
    partner was not true: <u>there was no partner</u>.
    This deception was necessary to enable the payment of large bonuses – data on the actions of your partner were not important for the research questions at hand,
    and would have consumed the budget for bonuses.
    <br>
<br>
<br>
    However, the potential bonus is still real: three participants will be randomly selected from this study
    to receive bonus payments based on their decisions in the task, from the second scenario, where you received $300.
    Since there is no partner, all payments will be calculated from the scenario with a starting successful
    theft rate of 60%, and assumes that the partner does try to steal from the selected participants, with successful thefts stealing $100.
<br>
<br>
    Selected participants' final bonuses will still be influenced by their decision to purchase security products.
    Each unit of the security product reduces the probability of a successful theft by 0.5%, meaning if someone purchased
    the maximum 100 units of security, they would reduce success rate of thefts by 50%.
<br>
<br>
    For instance, a selected participant purchasing 50 units of security will have $200 remaining
    when their partner attempts a theft at a 35% chance of success (adjusted from 60% success).
    If this theft is successful, the participant will get paid $100. If the theft is unsuccessful, the participant gets paid $200.

<!--<div><span>The consumption of security goods seems to indicate one’s mistrust and fear of other people.-->
<!--    Every dollar spent on a heavy-duty deadbolt cannot be spent on other goods such as savings or healthcare.-->
<!--    As such, some security goods are only worthwhile when assuming that others are malicious. </span></div>-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--<div><span>Currently, other humans (via murder) are only outranked by mosquitoes as the deadliest animal to modern Homo sapiens.-->
<!--    At the same time, our species’ success has been completely dependent on living and working closely together.-->
<!--    Understanding how and when people pay the costs of security may be instrumental in understanding how people navigate the dilemmas of competition and cooperation. </span></div>-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
<div><span>Studies suggests that inequality leads to risk-taking and conflict.
    In a “winner-takes-all” environment, individuals are more likely to resort to risky and criminal activities
    to effectively compete for desired goals (especially when they are relatively worse off).
    In a word, inequality breeds desperation. Given that inequality exists to some degree all modern societies,
    it is important to understand whether inequality causes people to expect desperation and risk-taking from others.
    This expectation of desperation may be critical in driving people’s willingness to consume products that protect them from harmful competitive behaviours. </span></div>
</p>


<div><span>
If our results show that inequality indeed leads to security consumption, it will highlight economic gaps as an
    important factor for managers and policy makers to consider when attempting to understand, predict, and satisfy people’s need for security.

Thank you for participating in this study! Your time and effort are very appreciated.

<p>
    Imagine that you and another study participant each received ${{ Constants.endowment }}. In this scenario:

    One of you will have the choice to try and steal money from the other, with a some chance of success.
    If an attempted theft fails, the attacker will instead lose ${{ Constants.endowment }}, with the target losing nothing.

    In this study, you will see a few different versions this game with different values.
    Please read these scenarios and adjust your choices accordingly

<div><span>This consent form is only part of the process of informed consent.
    It should give you the basic idea of what the research is about and what your participation will involve.
    If you would like more detail about something mentioned here, or information not included here, please ask.
    Take the time to read this carefully and to understand any accompanying information.
    You will receive a copy of this form for your records.</span></div>


<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>BACKGROUND:&nbsp;</span></u>

<div><span>Risk is part of everyday life, and how people navigate potential jackpots and disasters can have major consequences
    for individual and societal well-being. A major source of risk comes from other humans: people can be loyal friends,
    but also bitter rivals. One response to this interpersonal risk can be seen in a quickly-growing security industry,
    where people and industries are increasing spending on security cameras, guards, heavy-duty locks, and firewalls.
    However, little is understood about how people choose whether to expose or protect themselves from the actions of others.</span></div>

<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>WHAT WOULD I HAVE TO DO?:&nbsp;</span></u>

<div> <em><span>· You will complete a single online study, taking approximately 10 minutes to finish. In this study:</span></em></div>
<div> <em><span style='text-indent:36.0pt;'> · You will be asked to participate in a decision-making task along with a random partner,
    where one player will have the choice to try to steal money from the other.
    The other will choose how to spend an endowment on a product that reduces the likelihood of successful thefts.  </span></em></div>

<div> <em><span style='text-indent:36.0pt;'>· You’ll also be asked to complete few survey questions
    (e.g., risk attitudes, ambiguity aversion, trust, political ideology, experiences in crime victimization).  </span></em></div>



<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>WHAT ARE THE RISKS?:&nbsp;</span></u>

<div> <em><span>· As participants consider whether other people are a threat, and answer some potentially sensitive survey questions,
    there is a small risk of psychological discomfort.</span></em></div>


<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>WILL I BENEFIT IF I TAKE PART?:&nbsp;</span></u>

<div> <em><span>· There are no known benefits to you from participating in this study.</span></em></div>


<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Voluntariness and Withdrawal of consent:&nbsp;</span></u>

<div> <em><span>Your participation is voluntary and you can answer only those questions that you are comfortable with.
    You may withdraw from the research project for any reason, at any time without explanation or penalty of any sort.</span></em></div>


<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Withdrawal of Study Data:&nbsp;</span></u>

<div> <em><span>Given the anonymous nature of your participation, it will not be possible to withdraw your data after providing your responses.</span></em></div>


<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>WILL I BE PAID FOR PARTICIPATING, OR DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR ANYTHING?:&nbsp;</span></u>

<div> <em><span>· By participating in this study you will be compensated according to Prolific’s compensation scheme</span></em></div>


<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>What Type of Personal Information Will Be Collected? :&nbsp;</span></u>

<div> <em><span>· No personal identifying information will be collected in this study, and all participants shall remain anonymous.</span></em></div>
<div> <em><span>· Should you agree to participate, you will be asked to provide your gender, age, income, and education status. </span></em></div>

<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>WILL MY RECORDS BE KEPT PRIVATE?:&nbsp;</span></u>

<em><span>· Data from this research project will be published and presented at conferences in aggregate form. </span></em><br>
<em><span>· Furthermore, primary data will be anonymized retained indefinitely in a public repository for other researchers.</span></em><br>
<em><span>·  In both cases, it will not be possible to identify any individual respondent.</span></em><br>

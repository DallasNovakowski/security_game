<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Background&nbsp;</span></u>

<div><span>Risk is part of everyday life, and how people navigate potential jackpots and disasters can have major consequences
    for individual and societal well-being. A major source of risk comes from other humans: people can be loyal friends,
    but also bitter rivals. One response to this interpersonal risk can be seen in a quickly-growing security industry,
    where people and industries are increasing spending on security cameras, guards, heavy-duty locks, and firewalls.
    However, little is understood about how people choose whether to expose or protect themselves from the actions of others.</span></div>

<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>What Would I Have to Do?&nbsp;</span></u>

<div> <em><span>· You will complete a single online study, taking approximately 10 minutes to finish. In this study:</span></em></div>
<div> <em><span style='text-indent:36.0pt;'> · You will be asked to participate in a decision-making task along with a random partner,
    where one player will have the choice to try to steal money from the other.
    The other will choose how to spend an endowment on a product that reduces the likelihood of successful thefts.  </span></em></div>

<div> <em><span style='text-indent:36.0pt;'>· You’ll also be asked to complete few demographic questions  </span></em></div>



<br><u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>What are the Risks?&nbsp;</span></u>

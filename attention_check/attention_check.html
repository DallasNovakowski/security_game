//This bit creates 2 variables, one will function as a timer, the other will hold the timer output. They are set to 0 and -1 here to initialise them, these will not be the final outputs.

//This function automatically starts the timer when the page loads. In this case I want seconds so the interval is set to 1000, but I believe if you set it to 1 then it will count milliseconds - you will need to test this

};

//This function captures the timer output. When the timer starts it will increase 'pageTimeElapsed' every second and send this value to the 'timeSpent' variable that will be saved
//When a person moves to the next page, or the page times out, the final value that the timer was on will be saved. The value resets each round/page.

You have been paired with an Underestimator.
<br>
<br>
You have been given <u>${{ session.config.endowment }}</u>, but your partner has been given <u>${{C.OTHER_END}}</u>.
    Your partner knows how much money you each have received.
<br>
<br>
The money given to you and your partner was decided by another random participant in this session.
<br>
<br>
This third random participant (an Overestimator) chose between evenly splitting the money between you and your partner,
or giving one person more than the other ($150 for one, $300 for the other).

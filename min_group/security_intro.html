For the following game, your role has been determined randomly.

<br>
    <br>
    Your partner will have the option to try stealing money from you.
    If your partner tries and fails to steal, your partner loses money instead, with you losing nothing.
<br>
    <br>
    Before your partner makes their choice, you will have the chance to purchase a “security product,”
which will cost money, but each unit purchased will reduce Blue's chance of successfully stealing.
<br>
    <br>
    After you make your purchasing decision, your partner will see the updated chances of successful/failed thefts.

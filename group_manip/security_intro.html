For the following game, your role was determined randomly.

<br>
    <br>
    Your partner will have the option to try stealing money from you.
    If your partner tries and fails to steal, your partner loses money instead, with you losing nothing.
<br>
    <br>
    Before your partner makes their choice, you will have the chance to purchase a “security product.”
    The security product will cost money, but each unit purchased will reduce your partner's chance of successfully stealing.
<br>
    <br>
    After you make your purchasing decision, your partner will see the updated chances of successful/failed thefts.

};

//This function captures the timer output. When the timer starts it will increase 'pageTimeElapsed' every second and send this value to the 'timeSpent' variable that will be saved
//When a person moves to the next page, or the page times out, the final value that the timer was on will be saved. The value resets each round/page.

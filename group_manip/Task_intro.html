<p>
    Your guess for the number of dots on the image was used to categorize you as someone that
    over-estimates visual information, or someone that under-estimates.
    <br>
    <br>
<u><span style='font-weight:bold;'>You are: an Overestimator </span></u>
    <br>
    <br>

    Over-estimation or under-estimation is not related to intelligence or any other personality traits.

    Your status as an Overestimator will be visible to all other participants throughout the experiment.

    <br>
    <br>
    For the following task, you will be randomly paired with another participants in this study to play a game.
    <br>

//This bit creates 2 variables, one will function as a timer, the other will hold the timer output. They are set to 0 and -1 here to initialise them, these will not be the final outputs.

//This function automatically starts the timer when the page loads. In this case I want seconds so the interval is set to 1000, but I believe if you set it to 1 then it will count milliseconds - you will need to test this

};

//This function captures the timer output. When the timer starts it will increase 'pageTimeElapsed' every second and send this value to the 'timeSpent' variable that will be saved
//When a person moves to the next page, or the page times out, the final value that the timer was on will be saved. The value resets each round/page.

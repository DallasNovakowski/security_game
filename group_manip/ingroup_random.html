You have been paired with an Overestimator.
<br>
<br>
    You have been given ${{ session.config.endowment }}, but your partner has been given ${{C.OTHER_END}}.
    Your partner knows how much money you each have received.
<br>
<br>
The money given to you and your partner was randomly assigned.
<br>
<br>
This random process chose between evenly splitting the money between you and and your partner,
or giving one person more than the other ($1 for one, $2 for the other).

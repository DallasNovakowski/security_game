<p>
    You have been assigned to Yellow.
<br>
    <br>
    You have been given ${{ session.config.endowment }}, but your partner (Blue) has been given ${{Constants.other_end}}.
    Blue knows how much money you each have received.
<br>
    <br>
    Shortly, Blue will decide whether they will try to steal ${{ session.config.lost_from_attacks }} from you.
    If Blue attempts to steal, but fails, you will lose nothing, and they will lose ${{session.config.failed_attack}}.
<br>
    <br>
Before Blue makes the choice whether to attack, you will have the opportunity to spend some of your money on a security product.
    Each unit purchased will reduce Blue's chance of successfully stealing.
    After your purchasing decision, Blue will see their updated chances of success/failure.

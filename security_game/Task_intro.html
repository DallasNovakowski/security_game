    Imagine that you and another study participant each received ${{ Constants.endowment }}. In this scenario: <br> <br>

    One of you will have the choice to try and steal $1 from the other, with some chance of success.
    If an attempted theft fails, the attacker will instead lose $1, with the target losing nothing.

    In this study, you will see a few different versions this game with different values.<br> <br>
    Please read these scenarios and adjust your choices accordingly

//This function automatically starts the timer when the page loads. In this case I want seconds so the interval is set to 1000, but I believe if you set it to 1 then it will count milliseconds - you will need to test this

//This function captures the timer output. When the timer starts it will increase 'pageTimeElapsed' every second and send this value to the 'timeSpent' variable that will be saved
//When a person moves to the next page, or the page times out, the final value that the timer was on will be saved. The value resets each round/page.

Your partner (Blue) still has to decide whether to try stealing from you.

<label class="col-form-label">
<!--    For this scenario, an attempted theft will succeed <u><span id="base_prob"> </span>%</u> of the time.-->
    For this scenario, a successful theft steals $<span id="lost_from_attacks" ></span> from you,
    and a failed attempt to steal will make your partner lose $<span id="failed_attack" ></span>.
<br>
    <br>
         You will have the opportunity to buy up to 50 units of security.
    Each unit of security costs $<span id="price"> </span>, and always reduces the chance of a theft being successful.
    <br>
    <br>
    The exact effectiveness of security in preventing successful thefts is unknown, as are the existing chances of successful thefts.

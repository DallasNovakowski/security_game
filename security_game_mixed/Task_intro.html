<!--    In the following task, you will be given money and paired with another participant. -->
<!--    You will then be randomly assigned to different roles: Yellow or Blue.-->
<br>
    <br>

    Blue will have the option to try stealing money from Yellow. If Blue tries and fails to steal, Blue loses money instead, with Yellow losing nothing.
<br>
    <br>
    Before Blue makes their choice, Yellow will have the chance to purchase a “security product,” which will cost money, but each unit purchased will reduce Blue's chance of successfully stealing.
<br>
    <br>
    After Yellow makes their purchasing decision, Blue will see the updated chances of success/failure.

        <br>
        <br>
    You will see multiple scenarios that may differ slightly.

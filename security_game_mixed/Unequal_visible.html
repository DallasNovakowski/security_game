<p>
    For this scenario, you have been assigned to Yellow.
<br>
    <br>
    You have been given <u>${{ session.config.endowment }}</u>, but your partner (Blue) has been given <u>${{session.config.failed_attack}}</u>.
    Blue knows how much money you each have received.
<br>
    <br>
    Shortly, Blue will decide whether they will try to steal ${{ session.config.lost_from_attacks }} from you.
    If Blue attempts to steal, but fails, you will lose nothing, and they will lose ${{session.config.failed_attack}}.

    For this scenario, you have been assigned to Yellow.
<br>
    <br>
    You and your partner (Blue) have <u>each been given ${{ session.config.endowment }}</u>. Blue knows how much money you each have received.
<br>
    <br>
    Shortly, Blue will decide whether they will try to steal ${{ session.config.lost_from_attacks }} from you.
    If Blue attempts to steal, but fails, you will lose nothing, and they will lose ${{session.config.failed_attack}}.

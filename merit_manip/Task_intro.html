<p>
    You and another participant will both be given money to play a game.
    You will each be assigned to different roles: Yellow or Blue.
<br>
    <br>
    Blue will have the option to try stealing money from Yellow.
    If Blue tries and fails to steal, Blue loses money instead, with Yellow losing nothing.
<br>
    <br>
    Before Blue makes their choice, Yellow will have the chance to purchase a “security product,” which will cost money,
    but each unit purchased will reduce Blue's chance of successfully stealing.
<br>
    <br>
    After Yellow makes their purchasing decision, Blue will see how many units of security that Yellow has purchased.

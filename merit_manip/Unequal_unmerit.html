<p>
    For this scenario, you have been randomly assigned to Yellow.
<br>
    <br>
    Your partner (Blue) correctly placed more sliders than you, and thus, should have received more money than you.
    However, you have been given <u>${{ session.config.endowment }}</u>, but your partner (Blue) has been given <b>only</b> <u>${{C.OTHER_END}}</u>.
        <br>
        <br>
    Blue knows how much money you each have received.

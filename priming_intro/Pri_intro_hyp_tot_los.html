    For the following task, imagine that you have been paired with another participant.
    You will both be given money to play a game, and assigned to different roles: Yellow or Blue.
<br>
    <br>

    Blue will have the option to try stealing some money from Yellow.
    If Blue tries and fails to steal, Blue instead loses <u>all of their endowed money, and will also lose extra money out-of-pocket</u>, with Yellow losing nothing.
<br>
    <br>
    Before Blue makes their choice, Yellow will have the chance to purchase a “security product,”
    which will cost money, but each unit purchased will reduce Blue's chance of successfully stealing.
    Blue will see how many units of security that Yellow has purchased.


        <br>
        <br>
    You will see multiple scenarios that may differ slightly.
